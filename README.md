### indivial student project-1 - professional portfolio 
This project centers on crafting a professional profile website for front-end web development using the github.io cloud service. Within this scope, I've built a personal portfolio and launched it on GitHub's cloud platform. Technical specifications encompass the application of elementary JavaScript code, JQuery, and the React library. Additionally, integration of two public web APIs and the implementation of JavaScript cookies for user recognition and personalized greetings upon revisits are key components. Non-technical prerequisites involve adopting an open-source Bootstrap framework and integrating Google Analytics for page tracking.
